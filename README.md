# Cuisine Analysis

This repository contains a data analysis project focused on restaurant reviews, ratings, and price trends. The goal is to explore and extract insights from restaurant datasets using Python, Pandas, and NLP techniques.

##  Project Overview

We analyze restaurant data to:

- Identify the most common cuisines and their distribution.
- Determine the city with the highest number of restaurants.
- Calculate the average ratings of restaurants across different cities.
- Compare ratings of restaurants with and without online delivery.
- Visualize price range distributions among restaurants.
- Perform text analysis on reviews to find common keywords.
- Analyze the correlation between number of votes and ratings.

##  Features & Analysis

- **Top Cuisines Analysis** – Identify the most popular cuisines.
- **City-wise Analysis** – Find the city with the most restaurants and highest ratings.
- **Price Range Analysis** – Calculate the percentage of restaurants in each price category.
- **Online Delivery Impact** – Compare ratings of restaurants with and without delivery services.
- **NLP on Reviews** – Extract common positive and negative keywords from text reviews.
- **Correlation Analysis** – Explore relationships between votes, ratings, and price range.

##  Tech Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python 🐍
- **Libraries Used**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **NLP**: Scikit-learn (`CountVectorizer`)

##  Dataset

- The dataset contains information on restaurants, including:
  - Name, Location, and City
  - Cuisines offered
  - Ratings and Review texts
  - Price range and availability of online delivery
  - Number of votes

##  Visualizations

- **Bar charts** for price range distribution
- **Histograms** for restaurant ratings
- **Word clouds** for most common review words

##  How to Run the Code

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RishikaRavichandran/Cuisine-Analysis.git
   ```
2. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts:
   ```bash
   python analysis.ipynb
   ```

##  Future Enhancements

- Sentiment analysis on customer reviews.
- Predicting restaurant success based on available data.
- More advanced NLP techniques for review analysis.
